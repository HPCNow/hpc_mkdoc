ACC - Advanced Computing Center : Exacloud
==========================================

Exacloud is a high performance computing cluster at OHSU. The goal of this resource is to provide unique capabilities to OHSU researchers for supporting large-scale, computational and data intensive workflows.

The primary Exacloud cluster includes over 9,000 Xeon cores with 80 TB of memory distributed across 250 compute nodes. This computational resource includes dedicated, large-memory GPU nodes with advanced GPU's (NVIDIA P100 and V100). The Exacloud architecture includes a Lustre parallel file system, currently with 1.8 Petabytes of usable storage, which can provide users of the cluster with high-speed data access even when cluster utilization is high. Internally, the cluster primarily uses a 200 Gb/s Infiniband interconnect between the compute nodes and storage systems.
