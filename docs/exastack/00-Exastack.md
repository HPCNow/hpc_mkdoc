ACC - Advanced Computing Center : Exastack
==========================================

The Advanced Computing Center's Exastack environment is a local instance of [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), a very popular open source suite of cloud software applications. It is in many ways like an on-campus version of Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 service. Exastack will allow you to

-   set up and manage your own virtual machines (VMs); your VMs can run
    -   web services and applications
    -   databases
    -   custom login and development environments
    -   containers
-   set up and manage your own virtual networks
-   create and manage virtual disk drives that can be made visible to your virtual machine(s)
-   deploy a Kubernetes cluster

You may choose to make some of your VMs accessible from other OHSU networks; other VMs may be private, accessible only to your other Exastack VMs.

Your lab or group can purchase units of computing resources and you can deploy as resources as you have purchased. You might choose to purchase just enough quota to run one small VM, or you might decide you need to run several VMs in concert. Additionally, Exastack provides "flex" resources that will allow you to temporarily exceed your purchased quota; this gives you the flexibility to launch short-lived resource-intensive computing tasks that might otherwise surpass your quota.

If you're interested in getting access to Exastack, please open a Jira ticket with ACC with either [the ACC service desk](https://service.ohsu.edu/servicedesk/customer/portal/10) or by sending an e-mail to <acc@ohsu.edu>. In addition to purchasing a quota, you and your Exastack collaborators will also all need ACC accounts (which you may already have through other ACC services such as Exacloud).
